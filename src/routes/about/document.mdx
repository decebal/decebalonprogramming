As a professional my strong skills are around organizing code and building slick, scalable architectures.
I specialize in building back-end mainly on Golang and NodeJs. I enjoy building fast, automated jobs. Lately I adopted a Domain Driven Design mentality which makes life switching from spaghetti code bearable.

Some of the latest trends I joined are building API's with the help of go-lang and using Graph databases.
