- What is docker ?
    You can have a pick from these definitions smarter man gave:
    
    "Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications." - docker.io
    
    "Docker is a great image distribution model for server templates built with Configuration Managers (like Chef, Puppet, SaltStack, etc)" - [centurylink labs](http://www.centurylinklabs.com/what-is-docker-and-when-to-use-it/)

- Why should I use it ?

    You really don't have any reason why you shouldn't . If you can switch to, you would have solved so many pains in the ass and save more time to improve your app instead of fixing issues, that you won't think about the question above.

I've just completed my first back to back docker based web server. 

How I did it? The guys from digitalocean.com gave a hand with basics. After that I had to decide what I was going to use for the webserver and the frontend, I went with jekyll and nginx as I was dying to try it on a blog.

So after reading [a material on creating a docker image with an nginx server and jekyll](http://troy.im/2014/09/21/dockerizing-jekyll/) and how this other guy made his blog I've put my ideas straight and came up with my new blog nuuit.ro.

Oh and the docker newsletter is always full of good stuff, you can check it out [here](http://blog.docker.com/docker-weekly-archives/).

I have a full list of good references, I plan on doing posts on them, just because they deserve the attention, but to begin with it will sufice the above and to do a visit at hub.docker.com.
