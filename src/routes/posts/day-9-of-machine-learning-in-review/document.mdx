- [7 Companies Using Blockchain To Power AI Applications](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/blockchain-ai-startups/)
	
  More explicitly this looks at 7 companies exploring this new frontier at the intersection of blockchain, AI, and data marketplaces.
	
  I love what most of these companies propose, although at the moment their selling point might be on the part of exposing 
	data that wouldn't normally be exposed. I guess this is where my limitations are at the moment.
	
  Although I am confident these companies are serious and already have something on the market, their infrastructure 
	and data exchanges seem to be under development, but the prospect of early involvement can be quite enticing.
	
- [What a GAN is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network)

  This Wiki link is worth it as this higher order concept leads to many other 
	definitions that are worth keeping an account of.
	However, this wikipedia page is lacking, the next guide paints a way better picture.

- [Using Unsupervised Learning to plan a vacation to Paris: Geo-location clustering](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-unsupervised-learning-to-plan-a-paris-vacation-geo-location-clustering-d0337b4210de)

- [Deep Dive into Math Behind Deep Networks](https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-piotr-skalski92-deep-dive-into-deep-networks-math-17660bc376ba)

  This is enough to start on the Maths behind: *Single neuron*, *Single layer*

### Tools Encountered

- [Deep Learning for Java](https://deeplearning4j.org/index.html)

  Although I am not the biggest fan of Java, this library comes in handy for 
	some notions, the [examples](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples)
	are quite useful. Between them, MLP Neural Nets, Convolutional Neural Nets and  
	Recurrent Neural Nets interest me as I would not know enough about them or the
	others at this point.
