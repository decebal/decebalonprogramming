### Current setup:

We are using **snowflake-promise** as a wrapper to **snowflake-sdk** in an **appsync lambda resolver**.


### Issues with current setup:

1. Not being able to use a connection pool (results in )

```
Error [ClientError]: Connection already in progress.
```

2. OCP Cache

3. [Npm package is not up to date](https://github.com/natesilva/snowflake-promise/pulls) (Last publish: a year ago) and snowflake sdkâ€™s latest updates are not available as a [couple](https://github.com/natesilva/snowflake-promise/compare/master...flydata:master) of different forks have tried to [signal](https://github.com/natesilva/snowflake-promise/compare/master...timfenten:master)

### Has anyone tried to solve these issues before ?

1. Making the snowflake-sdk async

  - [AWS Lambda NodeJs with Snowflake](https://medium.com/@mazurkiewiczpw/aws-lambda-nodejs-with-snowflake-b5fdb35896e5)
  - [snowflake-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snowflake-promise)

2. Using a connection Pool

  - [snowflake-promise fork](https://github.com/natesilva/snowflake-promise/pull/19/files)
  - an open PR has suggested using a `isUp` method, which I merged on the fork above, but it did not make a difference in my case
  - I tried using a [Connection Pool](https://github.com/Tellimer/snowflake-sdk-promise/blob/master/src/SnowflakePool.ts), which worked well for our case

3. OCSP Cache

  - can be [be turned off](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/latest-changes-to-how-snowflake-handles-ocsp/)
  - [HOW TO: TURN OFF OCSP CHECKING IN SNOWFLAKE CLIENT DRIVERS](https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/How-to-turn-off-OCSP-checking-in-Snowflake-client-drivers)
  - having the check happen on each request is rather useless, following these [best practices](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ocsp.html#best-practices) should mitigate and eliminate the need for the OCSP check
