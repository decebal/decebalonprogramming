My first experience in following Azat Mardan, the author of this [course](https://www.udemy.com/nodeprogram). I discovered him through his blog while I was looking to solve some problems, he goes through the basic stuff and gives the feeling that he can respond clean and short to questions about the material.

- Main takeaways:
   1. Understanding of async programming and basic understanding of web programming in nodejs
   2. Acquired knowledge of server constructs and basic modules
   3. Illustrations of some of the greatest pitfalls
   
- Pro:
    1. Enjoyed the examples and the abundance of code near explanations
    2. Best part: bonus content
    3. Azat does best in writing
The course is really well structured with focal points and quizes after important lessons

- Cons:
    1. the course audience has some not so good questions or participation
    2. too much content direct at beginners in web, some content should be covered in a "web basics course" as it seems disturbing sometimes and it's clear that Azat does not deliver quality replies on this kind of dumb questions
    
Overall I appreciate that my skill has improved adding to my knowledge of web and solidifying some general knowledge about web infrastructure. I would recommend this course to anybody, it is definitely more rewarding than watching a tv show.
