Staying up to date with technology developments is an important part of a modern software 
developer's daily activity as well as one of the defining behaviours for a successful
career.

As an engineer I find it exciting to stay in the loop with what my peers are working with or towards.
Here is a list of daily newsletters that I am grateful for:

### General

- [PyCoders weekly](https://pycoders.com/) - python specific, this newsletter is 
a dose of news across multiple technical verticals related by the python programming 
language 

- [software lead weekly](https://softwareleadweekly.com/) - delivers a short email 
with inspirational opinions about culture inside software companies

- [GoLang Weekly](https://golangweekly.com/) - a dose of news across multiple technical verticals related by the python
 programming language, recently devops is quite a theme within goLang communities
 
- [StatusCode Weekly](https://weekly.statuscode.com/): "A weekly newsletter covering
software development, Web operations, infrastructure, platforms, and performance,
 from browser down to the metal." Their own description works best.
 
- [Cron Weekly](https://ma.ttias.be/cronweekly/issue-135/?via=newsletter): News articles
with security and DevOps at it's core. This is so good that I sometimes click through
all the links inside the weekly edition.

- [FoundersGrid](https://smash.vc/startup-newsletter/): A well put together list of
stories from different startUps. Short list with a well formed opinion near each link.

- [Maker Mind](https://us15.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=3463f6d8dc11321cc468d9f9c&id=d634852cd6): 
Similar with Founders Grid in format, focused on improving brain and practices.

- [Typescript Weekly](https://www.typescript-weekly.com/): This newsletter is
short and slim, typescript focused.

- [The Quantum Daily](https://thequantumdaily.com): There are not that many Quantum Computing focused
newsletters, this one kept my eye as it has some case studies and book recommendations 
such as [7 Quantum Computing Books For The Uninitiated](https://thequantumdaily.com/2020/05/15/7-quantum-computing-books-for-the-uninitiated/).

### Frontend
 
- [React Status](https://react.statuscode.com/): Love this one for exploring 
what other cool libraries are out there. React focused, while always comes with a load
of cool stories and experiments. 

- [Javascript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/): Similar to React Status, with
additional stories and suggestions from other frameworks such as VueJs 
or other libraries less front end focused.

- [WebAssembly Weekly](https://wasmweekly.news/): WebAssembly is a promising secure
web environment to bring other programming languages out of the backend end (joke).
The newsletter is slim for now, while still worthwhile to keep in the mail box. 

### Serverless

- [Serverless Status](https://serverless.email/issues): Serverless is one of the most
talked subjects these days, we have picked up at least one new feature each week
based on the suggestions in the serverless status weekly.

### AI

- [Inside AI](https://inside.com/ai): Rob May's roundup of stories and commentary
on Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and NeuroTechnology. Rob May is an authority
for me regarding companies built with AI at their core.

- [towards data science](https://towardsdatascience.com): Various research and case
 studies for data science.

### Books

- [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com): for some reason I always 
tend to find a bundle that will take me at least a year to go through.

- [Manning - Weekly Newsletter](https://www.manning.com): Manning seems to me to have
books always on the edge of programming that are worth keeping around when planning
new software products.
