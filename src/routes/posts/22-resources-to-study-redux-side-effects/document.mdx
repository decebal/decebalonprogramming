In my learning journey, I have a habit of building a list of resources that I am about to study in order to extract something more specific into an ulterior blog article or in implementing a certain software feature.

My end goal after going through the following resources is to have result in a blog post explaining what Redux Side Effects are about and how and when they can be used. Might be a series of blog posts to be fair, if this subject's worthy enough.
