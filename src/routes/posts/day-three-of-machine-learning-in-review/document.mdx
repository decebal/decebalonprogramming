    - [Theano](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/)
    - [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) = Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding
    - [Torch](http://torch.ch/)
    - [Accord.Net](http://accord-framework.net/)

* [Machine Learning - a Github Collection](https://github.com/collections/machine-learning)
	A really good source of training data sets and classified algorithms to explore.

* [Comet QuickStart](https://www.comet.ml/decebal/quickstart)

 I don't know about you, but I am a sucker for visualizing things when trying to grasp new concepts, thank you [Jay Allamar](https://jalammar.github.io/) for this awesome blog.
 He's visuals about neural networks are worth several ml courses:
 
  - [A Visual And Interactive Look at Basic Neural Network Math](https://jalammar.github.io/feedforward-neural-networks-visual-interactive/)
  - [A Visual and Interactive Guide to the Basics of Neural Networks](https://jalammar.github.io/visual-interactive-guide-basics-neural-networks/)
