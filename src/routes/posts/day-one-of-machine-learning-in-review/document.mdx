First and foremost I felt I need to do this with a purpose, an end goal.
I would love to be able to *diagnose profanity from uploaded pictures* at the end of this, but it feels somewhat limiting to start with this one so I decided to explore goals that I can set at the end of my first week into this within an industry or cause.
Hopefully I will have some more clarity on how I can contribute towards bringing "The Rising Billion" (Reference from ["Abundance"](https://amzn.to/2Jneq8a)) closer to western living standards. 

I chose to review my Machine Learning Resources to start with and expose them here with some comments on their usefulness towards my goal. 


## What is #100DaysOfMLCode?

To start off, let me save you a few keystrokes:

- twitter tag [#100DaysOfMLCode](https://twitter.com/search?vertical=default&q=%23100DaysOfMLCode) or facebook [#100DaysOfMLCode](https://www.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=%23100daysofmlcode)
- [100 Days of ML Code Challenge](https://youtu.be/cuQMBj1cWPo)
- wiki page for [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)
- youtube is apparently full with information, not just for beginners [Machine Learning on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=machine+learning)

Here are a few entries I went through from people already taking on the challenge:

- [WhiteChills trying Support Vector Regression](https://whitechills.com/day-2-of-100daysofmlcode/)
- [Lenilson Nascimento going through his learning live](https://youtu.be/3sz4Y4Apa-o)
- ["The info grid" introduction of this tag](https://theinfogrid.com/tech/machine-learning/100daysofmlcode-join-the-challenge-and-learn-machine-learning/)
- [mc.ai introductory post](https://mc.ai/100daysofmlcode/), he's got some more Machine Learning articles on the blog, I really enjoyed going through [Serving Pytorch NLP models on AWS Lambda](https://mc.ai/serving-pytorch-nlp-models-on-aws-lambda/)
- [A rather funny introduction by Trackster](https://youtu.be/uEdAinZeHN0)

So basically there are 2 main rules:

- dedicate at least **One Hour a Day** for 100 Days to learning or coding Machine Learning
- **document your journey** in order to make your dedication public

## Why take on this challenge ?

- My belief is that **learning something new** adjacent to your daily work is tricky, a challenge like Raj's can just about bring out some inherent motivation to the surface
- If you are considering a career in the field, taking on a challenge like this would help build something to showcase your skills and talents while learning, take a look at *Engineered Thruth's* perspective on [How To Get A Job in Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/WtbejUEcPaU)
- This is FUN!
- Also as a software developer reading [What machine learning means for software development](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development)  convinced me I need to start and extend my skills into this domain. By the way [O'Reilly AI](https://www.oreilly.com/topics/ai) is an amazing source of information *for beginners* in this field.
- [TRAIN AI 2018 - Building the Software 2.0 Stack](https://vimeo.com/272696002) convinced me of the paradigm shift being eminent. New paradigm: instead of engineered code, make use of ai to find code that does what you need, while paying in *compute power*

## Where to find my code

I plan to submit most of my code will be submitted on [100DaysOfML](https://github.com/decebal/100DaysOfML). 
Don't worry if you don't see nothing there yet. [#SWGD](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephanie-huston/6-practical-tips-for-gett_b_12253736.html)

## Resources for study


### My resources for trying to identify an end goal

- [How to think about AI and machine learning technologies, and their roles in automation](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-to-think-about-ai-and-machine-learning-technologies-and-their-roles-in-automation)

> reinforcement learning excels at problems that fall outside the realm of unsupervised and supervised machine learning

> Despite these challenges, reinforcement learning is beginning to see real-world usage in areas like industrial automation

- Bloomberg's [The Rise of AI](https://youtu.be/Dk7h22mRYHQ) Series 

  A few golden nuggets:

  - If you want to understand a brain, build one first! (engineering approach)
 
  - "This is not going to work" vs "I am not going to make this work"
 
  - if we are to build intelligent life it is likely to understand our values and how to make the best use of us, rather than a "Terminator" scenario
  - danger comes from misuse of AI, eg mass manipulation 

- Singularity University Summits' Youtube playlist of [Exponential Manufacturing 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPGzxWD223Q&list=PLQU8wUs2JFrXGsO6IW1DjBpM_h0knFqUf). This one is just packed with amazing ideas being explored, Additive Manufacturing and Collaborating Robots being my 2 favourites.

- Rob May's [Inside AI](https://inside.com/ai) 

  Rob is a founder and VC in this space with amazing insight and interest in the current AI ecosystems.

### Resources explored on day one

Quick Note, I run by ["A BAD Plan is BETTER Than NO Plan!"](https://youtu.be/sCLHNP3cT3g).

- [Machine Learning APIs by Example (Google I/O '17)](https://youtu.be/ETeeSYMGZn0)
- [The Race to Quantum AI](https://youtu.be/3ZiGmJipYG0)
- [Machine Learning for HumansðŸ¤–ðŸ‘¶](https://medium.com/machine-learning-for-humans/why-machine-learning-matters-6164faf1df12)
- [Tensorflow.js Explained by Siraj Raval](https://youtu.be/Nc8kZABv-KE)
- [Backpropagation Explained by Siraj Raval](https://youtu.be/FaHHWdsIYQg)
- [A Feature Selection Tool for Machine Learning in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-feature-selection-tool-for-machine-learning-in-python-b64dd23710f0)

Unfortunately I didn't get too much code on day one, this needs to change quick, looking forward for day 2.
