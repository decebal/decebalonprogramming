## Machine Learning (Educators and Entrepreneurs)

[Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg)
---

One of the most amazing channels out there, small and targeted, there is no better advocate for Machine Learning than Two Minute Papers.

[Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A)
---

Siraj brings a ton to the table and does his best to make learning fun, definitely my kind of fun, see for yourself.


[Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/user/lexfridman)
---

Lex has a ton of great people relevant to Machine Learning interviewed.

[DeepMind](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7jMXSY2xbc3KCAE0MHQ-A)
---

Practical tutorials and introduction to Machine Learning from DeepMind.

[ForrestKnight](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2WHjPDvbE6O328n17ZGcfg)
---

I only looked at the AI and Machine Learning experiments here as the rest of the "Software Programming" advice seems a little misguided to me, certainly biased by his environment.


[Manning Publications](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDia_lkNYKLJVLRLQl_-pFw/featured)
---

Manning is one of the main sources of technical books in my library, this channel 
used to be rather a promotional avenue where authors got to promote their books while
recently they got some hour long videos of unique content related to some books
that I found to be fascinating. They also have a presence on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/manningpublications/).

I only had a couple of views:

- [Barry Pollard Analyses Websites To See If They Will Benefit From HTTP/2](https://youtu.be/xAVu7xb0mVI)
- [Chris Mattmann Discusses TensorFlow and his Work at NASA JPL](https://youtu.be/XdUOFsdKwRg)

## DevOps Heavy

[VMware Cloud Native Apps](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdkGV51Nu0unDNT58bHt9bg)
---

This channel has developed substantially over the past year, in particular what draws
my interest are the [Heptio team](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjQU5ZI2mHswy7OOsii_URg)'s k8s related explorations. The way they explore and expose
different tools around k8s ecosystem is extremely easy to follow. Most of the time
I put one of their exploratory videos and get on with my predefined tasks for the day.
There are several other video types on this channel which would be helpful depending on your journey.

The format and the resources shared are highly valuable, I recommend using these videos
as a benchmark for software development courses.

Here are a few of my favourite videos:

 - [TGI Kubernetes 030: Exploring Skaffold](https://youtu.be/McwwWhCXMxc)
 - [TGI Kubernetes 073: Exploring Garden with Kubernetes](https://youtu.be/Xfi9XqcZ76M)
 - [TGI Kubernetes 106: Flagger - Advanced Application Rollout](https://youtu.be/HQX6wImrLTw) 


[The Linux Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfX55Sx5hEFjoC3cNs6mCUQ)
---

The Linux Foundation channel is so awesome for the open source communities around the
world, I am not even sure where to start. There are past conferences to be explored in
their own playlists/sections, [Linus Torvalds](https://youtu.be/s8EKVNcD1ko) one of my
personal favourite people of all time is featured in multiple instances while clearly
involved and followed at conferences, while fresh content from conferences around the
world is constantly added, definitely an active channel in 2020.


## Serverless

[ServerlessDays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYzAnR_SebAmLRkKIbK_YoQ)
---

The channel serves as an archive for the conferences with the same name, they happen
across the Europe and North America focusing on serverless use cases.

An example:

- [The Bleeding Edge at Scale: 80-million users on Serverless and GraphQL - Tyler Love](https://youtu.be/eTLeLEsTVKw)

[FooBar Serverless](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSLIvjWJwLRQze9Pn4cectQ)
---

FooBar covers serverless(as in AWS Lambda) and some other related AWS Technologies,
if your stack is hosted in AWS these videos are amazing to share around a team even after implementation.

Two Picks:

- [Introduction to GraphQL | AWS AppSync Series | #1](https://youtu.be/wxbHTCpPxpw)
- [Introduction to AppSync | AWS AppSync Series | #2](https://youtu.be/E9GecpNn6vY)


[Lambda World](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEBcDOjv-bhAmLavY71RMHA)
---

For anyone interested in Functional Programming this conference is between the most relevant
ones on the subject, they've got a [conference page](https://www.lambda.world/) for more details 
regarding future editions.

Here's a recommendation: [Lambda World 2019 - Unconference](https://youtu.be/Y6FMjGxaNGk).

[Gunnar Grosch](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTltOOcP1UZTpEQKQjjO-5Q)
---

- [Serverless chaos - Blast radius containment](https://youtu.be/Cw-JmAJHG-g)
- [Serverless chaos - From Latency to Failure](https://youtu.be/vKurdrGMFpg)


## Top-Level views and Leadership

[Singularity University](https://www.youtube.com/user/singularityu)
---

Used to be at [Singularity University Summits](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0ysB63L6-CidHWWBTZoZcQ) which is one
of the most extraordinary organizations in the world where technology is being explored
in order to push further humanity's improvements.

Some of my highlights:

 - [Peter Diamandis | The Future Is Faster Than You Think | Global Summit 2018 | Singularity University](https://youtu.be/FTTgdtl8FvM)

[Stefan Mischook](https://www.youtube.com/user/killerphp)
---

[LeadDev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmM3eCpmWKLJj2PDW_jdGkg)
---

As a Lead Dev I found this channel and the stories being told at LeadDev conferences
full of insights and golden nuggets.

Nickolas Means airplane stories are a popular highlight:

- [How to crash an airplane – Nickolas Means | The Lead Developer UK 2016](https://youtu.be/099cHWSbAL8)
- [The Original Skunk Works – Nickolas Means | The Lead Developer UK 2017](https://youtu.be/pL3Yzjk5R4M)

- [Communicating and documenting architectural decisions - David Ayers](https://youtu.be/rwfXkSjFhzc)


[Silicon Real](https://www.youtube.com/user/SiliconReal)
---

Silicon Real is the Talk Show dedicated to the People of the London Technology Startup Scene.
It seems it has been more than 4 years since Brian has moved on with London Real while
the initial Silicon Real show has inspired myself and a whole host of european entrepreneurs
to take action and change their careers. The show archive is still available on youtube
and is worth considering a listen for developing an entrepreneurial mind to say the least. 

I picked four highlights from the show archive,
which I highly recommend for anyone involved in the tech scene in Europe:

- [Ivan Mazour of Ometria | Silicon Real](https://youtu.be/oHEOyLSpw80)
- [Emily Brooke of Blaze | Silicon Real](https://youtu.be/U6Uv229XgHE)
- [Damian Kimmelman of DueDil | Silicon Real](https://youtu.be/vybtcBBicV4)
- [Sam Shank of HotelTonight | Silicon Real](https://youtu.be/cTIdbsnYN7Q)

## JavaScript Programming Educators

[Kyle Simpson](https://www.youtube.com/user/theshadedecho)
---

Kyle is a gifted speaker and a dedicated educator, the channel does not amount to much
while he surely would be found on a few preeminent conference panels.

He uses javascript and is an advocate of simplicity.
These are three of my favourites from him:

- [Functional-Light JavaScript](https://youtu.be/b5CO2WntCOA)
- [Advanced Async and Concurrency Patterns in JavaScript](https://youtu.be/Qg1SvpIau6U)
- [Kyle Simpson defends JavaScript Coercion's bad reputation](https://youtu.be/WoL4BfSv7pI)
- [Kyle Simpson and Tammy Everts on the Challenges of the Modern Web](https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/kyle-simpson-and-tammy-everts-on-the-challenges-of-the-modern-web?in=oreilly-radar/sets/oreilly-programming-podcast)

[Fun Fun Function](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q)
---

Highly biased by javascript and front-end technologies, the channel is very practical
with tons of great content that also cover other parts of the stack and of a programmer's
day to day activity.

Latest advice I am following:

- [Run Prettier in CI, NOT as an editor plugin](https://youtu.be/BPHLz0lQ6Fg)
- [Dependency Injection basics- Fun Fun Function](https://youtu.be/0X1Ns2NRfks)


[J On The Beach](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3KyKpIyhLAnIUqcYBo4PFg)
---

Another awesome spanish hosted programming conference channel.

A couple of my picks:

- [JOTB19 - When Cloud Native meets the Financial Sector by Victor Tuson](https://youtu.be/MVVSsLTQK1g)
- [JOTB19 - The Six Pitfalls of building a Microservices Architecture by Moisés Macero](https://youtu.be/6x0BPHG0dRY)

---

- [Svelte.js 3 and Sapper Projects: The Course Overview | packtpub.com](https://youtu.be/E4oh11WDWHo)


## General Programming and Algorithms

[Khan Academy Computing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCye0TMXdb_zdfvVgXA0XtkA)
---

Khan Academy does not put out much video content, mostly targeting beginners,
their videos are mostly support for courses, but find them as a brief and amazing
reminder for algorithms and techniques.

[HackerRank](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOf7UPMHBjAavgD0Qw5q5ww)
---

Hacker rank is producing great content targeting engineer recruitment and training.

Some content picks from both sides:

- [How to Evaluate Tech Skills Better](https://youtu.be/KG0aU73HOXE)
- [5 Tips to Improve your Engineering Manager Relationship](https://youtu.be/N9CsFY8cpdk)

## Links with Physics

[meQuanics](https://www.youtube.com/user/meQuanics)
---

One of the few technical relevant channels on the subject of Quantum Computing,
at this point in time the video content is less relevant, so listening to the [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/mequanics)
would be my recommended way of consuming the information.


[Sabine Hossenfelder](https://www.youtube.com/c/SabineHossenfelder)
---

The science professor does not steer away from offering a controversial opinion on the scientific approaches, 
all the while delivering value by using practical evidence and going deeper into the Physics around the subject at hand.
As it happens most of the subjects tackled are also of great exposure to the public these days.
The Physics subject that predominates is Quantum Mechanics.

- [The 10 Most Important Physics Effects](https://youtu.be/0GCHzbmMZf0)
- [Understanding Quantum Mechanics #1: It’s not about discreteness](https://youtu.be/XJSfgE9LUJw)
- [Does the world need a larger particle collider?](https://youtu.be/WIMGAFL8DVk)

[Your Daily Equation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T44nS6xJ1Fc&list=PLKy-B3Qf_RDVL6Z_CmgKf0tAbpXTua9mV)
---

This rather different entry is a playlist comprised of Brian Green's series for the "World Science Festival" channel,
which is as big as a television channel these days. I love this series as Brian Green gives the best
analogies for the Physics under discussion in the respective episode.
The Physics subject that predominates is "understanding Time".

- [Your Daily Equation #1: E = mc2](https://youtu.be/G_NlwfA8x0o)
- [Your Daily Equation #2: Time Dilation](https://youtu.be/nnVq6gmatHU)
- [Your Daily Equation #32: Entropy and the Arrow of Time](https://youtu.be/x4iU76Qj2mU)
