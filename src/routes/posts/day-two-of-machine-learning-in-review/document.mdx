- [Machine learning needs machine teaching](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/machine-learning-needs-machine-teaching)
> Machine teaching and machine learning are necessary complements to one another; you need both. And for the large part, most of what comprises machine teaching these days consists of giant label data sets.

> Common use cases for reinforcement learning: [..] tuning

> Machine Teaching is the new *Programming*

- [How machine learning can be used to write more secure computer programs](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-machine-learning-can-be-used-to-write-more-secure-computer-programs)
> As an example, when you find a vulnerability in code, the question that often arises is whether there are similar vulnerabilities still in that same program.

- [How machine learning will accelerate data management systems](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-machine-learning-will-accelerate-data-management-systems)
> ML tools will free them [database administrators] to focus on complex tasks that are harder to automate.

> compute is becoming much cheaper. Suddenly, using machine learning to train this mapping actually pays off. 

- [Machine Learning for Humans](https://medium.com/machine-learning-for-humans)

Planning to go through this beginner ready series of tutorials, I like the way the're explained so far.

- [H2O](https://www.h2o.ai/)

Makes for an interesting exploration in AI , going through this list of steps to start with: http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-wright/3/index.html .
Also planning to go through this [Deep Learning with H2O](http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-wright/3/docs-website/h2o-docs/booklets/DeepLearningBooklet.pdf) in order to try the h2o library offerings.
