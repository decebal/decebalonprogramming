### Resources explored

For people whom need a little more structure I looked into some courses,
here's what I found so far:

* Practical Convolutional Neural Networks: The Course Overview | packtpub.com
	https://youtu.be/EgKQeuwmTEk
	
  - Looks amazingly useful for beginners
  - Love the examples
  - Authors seem well versed on the subject 

* TensorFlow 1.x Deep Learning Recipes for Artificial Intelligence App: Course Overview | packtpub.com
	https://youtu.be/RMILgtLeNVc
	
  - Dives into Deep Learning and generally goes a step further that the previous course
  - The recipes for TensorFlow are my personal favourite
	
* [Driven Data Competitions](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/)

  - their competition model almost ensures they always have a challenge open, currently 3-4 open
  - found this data source that might be useful for other purposes as well: https://data.worldbank.org/, 
	although at first glance I wouldn't know where to start if i was looking for a specific data set

* [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)

  - You can even see Suraj (author of #100DaysOfMLCode Challenge) competing on his channel: https://youtu.be/suRd3UzdBeo
    - watching this approach of Suraj would give you the insights necessary to his development process 
  - I just had to pick a few really interesting challenges:
    - [TrackML Particle Tracking Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification)
        I just love what CERN is doing, it's great to see how the new tech can be useful for old research processes 
    - [Zillowâ€™s Home Value Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1)
        This one I picked as would just love to be able to do this for myself.
    - [iMaterialist Challenge (Furniture) ](https://www.kaggle.com/c/imaterialist-challenge-furniture-2018)
        This is a past challenge, but it makes for a great task that I could get involved in. 
        Something like: Recognize valuable furniture in a second-hand/charity shop. 



* [Build a Neural Net in 4 Minutes](https://youtu.be/h3l4qz76JhQ)

* [Plant Identification - Picture This App](https://www.picturethisai.com/)

  - when it works it's amazingly powerful
  - great idea of putting Neural Networks to work
  - the app still has some issues especially as I tried it out in the wild and was saying it had no connection, basically it needed loads of data to download
  - I love the use of community in this one in order to train the models

  - Some other resources on the subject:

    - [Deep Learning for Plant Identification in Natural Environment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5458433/)
    - [Plant identification based on very deep convolutional neural networks](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-017-5578-9)
    - [Plant identification using deep neural networks via optimization of transfer learning parameters](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231217300498)
    - [DEEP-PLANT: PLANT IDENTIFICATION WITH CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08425.pdf)
    - Original Article: [This App Will Help You Identify the Plants and Animals You See in Nature](https://curiosity.com/topics/this-app-will-help-you-identify-the-plants-and-animals-you-see-in-nature-curiosity)

  - One such experiment: [A.I. Experiments: Visualizing High-Dimensional Space](https://youtu.be/wvsE8jm1GzE)
