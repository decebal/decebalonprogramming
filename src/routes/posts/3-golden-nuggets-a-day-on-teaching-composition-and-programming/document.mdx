Today I have introduced a new section to each of the past ones: **My Impressions** inspired by

My one golden nugget: 

**teaching can unlock the passion within instead of trying to rewrite everything from scratch while allowing for politics.**

My one impression:

*In my programming career and professional life I am known for my desire to always adhere to coding standards while trying to use the latest tools available, should I have a think on changing my approach to pushing good code forward and turn it into educational content for my colleagues ?*

  - This one comes with some downsides for me and the likes of people whom have no exercise in one to one education, tools that I decided to explore as a result: packt publishing for tech course publishing, youtube or other media streams.

*The Power of Composition - Scott Wlaschin*

My one golden nugget:

  *functions need to be standalone. Consider types of nouns and verbs. Noun = Data Structure, Verb = Behaviour.*

  Functional programming problem solution steps:

  1. identify unique functions
  2. define functions
  3. pipeline your functions accordingly
 

My one impression:

  *Currying is the process that allows chaining by transforming a multi-input function into one-input function.* 

  Put I/O operations at the start or end of your pipeline, while in the middle only keep pure functions

  Map: apply single input function to a list
  
  Bind: transform a one input 2 output function into a 2 input 2 output function (adds an input)
  getting composition to work

My one golden nugget:

> new paradigm: instead of engineered code, make use of AI to find code that does what you need

My one impression:

*How can I get involved into creating new stacks using AI while adding on my skills instead of ditching them and start from scratch ?*
