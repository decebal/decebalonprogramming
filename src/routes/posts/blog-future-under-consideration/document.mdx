Taken that I suffer from the same "do not post until perfect" or "i don't have time to finish my post" disease, what most of my fellow programmers with a blog seems to suffer, I've taken under consideration to dedicate 15 minutes every day to write  something, anything on my blog. No matter what the day reserves I will dedicate 15 minutes to posting on this blog and acquiring some English skills as a side-effect .
