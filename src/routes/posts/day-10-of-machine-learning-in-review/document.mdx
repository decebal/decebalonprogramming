* What Kind Of Data Scientist Do You Want To Be?
  
  Video: https://youtu.be/QB2r06mpI0I

  According to this video, there are several data scientist archetypes:

  - The Detective, a master of analysis,
  - The Oracle, a master of modeling,
  - The Maker, a master of engineering, and
  - The Generalist, proficient at everything.

  I liked the fact that they offered insights on the niches of Machine Learning
  inside a company. Looking forward I was so tempted to set myself the goal of 
  becoming a Generalist without realising how good an Oracle I am.

  I loved the point made about people in the industry that avoid becoming proficient
  in data mechanics.

  Loads of fun, knowledge and practical bits.
  Comes with a plethora of great link, here is what I went thorough briefly:

* How to Study Machine Learning

  Here is my assessment of my own situation through the steps:
	
  1. *Live a healthy lifestyle.*
    I gave up a gym subscription in February due to an expectation of moving home,
     but I have already started to pay the price. I can confirm an ever improving
     healthy lifestyle was at the root of my professional rise so far. For the past
     3 months I have been working on my diet. I consider part of it to be a dose
     of daily reading as it keeps the mind active and I gave up listening to music
     while working, instead I listed to youtube case studies. I failed to integrate 
     podcasts into my routine so far.
  2. *Optimize your learning environment.* I cannot wait to swap houses, 
    already overdue due to lender complications. The new house has a dedicated
    room to study and video recording.
  3. *Create a personalized learning path.* I plan to use my 15 days of 
    the challenge to put a plan in place. I am an audio learner, but learning 
    ML needs all my senses.     	
  4. *Prioritize* I too have todo lists, with the help of airtable I was able 
    to bring all of my lists together. Each morning I make sure to put the most important
    3 tasks for the day in my Today list while updating a backlog for the day. 
  5. *Be an active learner.* I love the Fast framework myself, while on more complex
    tasks like learning a new language I love applying [John Sonmez](https://simpleprogrammer.com/)'s
    10 step method based on the same Fast principles. My method of teaching others
    at the moment consist in writing blog articles, I am eager to expand it to video 
    recordings. I had a try last summer with Packt Publishing, but my current situation
    makes it complicated for video recordings.
