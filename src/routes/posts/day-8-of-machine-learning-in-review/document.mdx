### Resources explored

- [Smaller Collaborative Robots Are Disrupting The Robotics Industry](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/collaborative-robots-reinvent-industries/)

  I love the reports from [www.cbinsights.com](https://www.cbinsights.com/), their research does more than scratch the surface and often offers myself a way to link up ideas with the state of the market. As it stands I have no partnership with them, I just consider them an awesome resource.
	
  *Warning, exponentially difficult business idea:*
	Personally after reading the report I started dreaming of a personal cook robot with an AI that can adjust recipes based on my feedback on food and tailor it differently for my wife or my future children. 

- [Lenia - Mathematical Life Forms](https://github.com/Chakazul/Lenia)
	
  I have no clue how I can use this, but I am a sucker for learning Maths concepts through visualizations, this could come in handy later in my research.
	So far I have only got to look at https://chakazul.github.io/Lenia/JavaScript/Lenia.html and play with the presents without any understanding of what is actually going on :).
	The fact that I couldn't find anything by googling the animals name didn't help a great lot either.

- [jupyter-repo2docker](https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker)

  I just used this on [CoinAi](https://github.com/techbanca/coinai) on my way to try 
	and explore crypto currency auto trading and statistics.
	
  Really useful tool as long as it works on your targeted repository.

- [Two Minute Papers ](https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz/videos)
	
  I wouldn't say this is great for learning, but an amazing resource for news in AI.
	The format of 2-4 minutes per video is enough for delivering the news wanted to make you curious about it,
	while keeping them close to the subject.
	
  A few examples:
	
  - [An AI For Image Manipulation Detection](https://youtu.be/WMr9ljLomUI) In this one, I find it of great help that he goes into enough specialised detail 
		to surface how the AI does the job and what constrains it has.
	
  - [AI-Based Large-Scale Texture Synthesis](https://youtu.be/KL6U6iasUxs) This example is a good one for how good they are at exposing the use case of the AI involved.
	
  *If you know of other similar sources please do share, along with your opinion if you'd like.
	
- [Data BlockChain](https://www.datablockchain.io/)	
	
  Their subtitle looks like this: "ï»¿Merging Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain Technology to Bring Critical Information to the World"
	Which made me curious, but so far as I couldn't find anything else to explain their [use cases](https://medium.com/dbc-io/3-use-cases-for-datablockchain-io-5ad4bbda8425) I find these as rather marketing stunts in order to attract attention to their IPO.
	
  However a Data Marketplace alone is an amazing proposition, my worry looking through it is that I don't understand the source.
	A data marketplace is any public blockchain, or maybe I need a better understanding to unclad my ignorance.

- [Neural Networks on Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/search?content_type=tops&page=1&query=neural%20networks)

  Forgive my ignorance if you already knew about this, but I find this collection of resources amazing to start with. 

  - I have a knack for picking up old books, like 
	[Neural Networks and Pattern Recognition](https://www.scribd.com/book/282476058/Neural-Networks-and-Pattern-Recognition),
	 might be old in terms of publishing (1997), but it would make for a good introduction 
	 to the methods of Pattern Recognition as theory.

  - [Deep Learning Fundamentals in Python](https://www.scribd.com/book/325574423/Deep-Learning-Fundamentals-in-Python)
	 is an introduction to the basics of Neural Networks. Looks great for settling some fundamentals if you're into reading.
	 The introduction alone is enough for me.
	 
  - [Artificial Neural Networks Architecture Applications](https://www.scribd.com/document/146626812/Artificial-Neural-Networks-Architecture-Applications)
	is amazing for the stage I am at as it exposes use cases like 
	"Use of Artificial Neural Networks to Predict TheBusiness Success or Failure of Start-Up Firms"
	or "Robust Design of Artificial Neural NetworksMethodology in Neutron Spectrometry".
	This type of book is something I can easily get behind and search for more similar through scribd's features.		

- [KMeans in less than 5 minutes](https://medium.com/@adityakaushik471/kmeans-algorithm-25634378261b)
	
  K-means clustering is a classification algorithm used to automatically divide a large group into smaller groups.
	
- [Best Programming Languages for Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/-cdxxrbKdho)

  Suraj goes through Python and Javascript as programming languages for Machine Learning.
	There are plenty more to consider, my favourites are Julia and Go-Lang.

- [Event Registry](http://eventregistry.org/intelligence?type=articles)
	
  Real time news content published by over 30,000 news publishers worldwide.
	
  This type of resource is a great start on fake news break down effort 
	as well as a source for media publications.

- [Twitter Sentiment Analysis - Learn Python for Data Science #2](https://youtu.be/o_OZdbCzHUA)

  Just went through [this sample from Suraj](https://github.com/llSourcell/twitter_sentiment_challenge/blob/master/demo.py) and took the liberty to explore the tools referred in [Sentiment Analysis Tools Overview](https://medium.com/@datamonsters/sentiment-analysis-tools-overview-part-2-7f3a75c262a3)
	with his code and must say the packages for R helped me a great deal.
