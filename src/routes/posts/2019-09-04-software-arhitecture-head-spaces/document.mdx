## Building Evolutionary Architectures [#evolutionary-architecture](/tags/evolutionary-architecture)

- fitness functions
- fitness functions for Serverless architectures
- monitoring evolution with fitness functions
- when to use **safe deployments** ?
- using bounded contexts inside a Serverless architecture. is it worth further segregating layers ? 
- takeaways form the book: "Building Evolutionary Architectures" from O'reilly, authored by *Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons and Patrick Kua*

## Serverless 2.0 [#serverless2.0](/tags/serverless2.0)

- using serverless.com with kubeless
- OpenFaas vs kubeless
- gitlab integrations (has one with kubeless)
- monorepo of domain functions
- polyglot monorepo
- A Comparison of Serverless Frameworks for Kubernetes: OpenFaas, OpenWhisk, Fission, Kubeless and more

## Building Evolutionary Architectures with Serverless 2.0

- support for monitoring fitness functions out of the box
- e2e tests inside a CI box

## Domain Driven Design Tools for Typescript and Serverless [#DDD](/tags/DDD)

- defining types and tested domains in TS -> similar to [value objects in php](https://github.com/funeralzone/valueobjects) and [value objects generator in php](https://github.com/funeralzone/valueobject-generator)
- generating types and tested domains based on a/some config file(s) -> similar to [value objects generator in php](https://github.com/funeralzone/valueobject-generator)
- monorepo generator -> yeoman enhanced generator with DDD
- [mixins](https://www.bryntum.com/blog/the-mixin-pattern-in-typescript-all-you-need-to-know/) and [Data Class](https://github.com/alexeyraspopov/dataclass/blob/master/README.md) for better defining Ubiquitous Language in TypeScript
- takeaways from [Khalil Stemmler's blog posts on DDD](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/tags/ddd/)
- review "Domain Driven Distilled" by *Vaughn Vernon*

## GraphQl [#graphql](/tags/graphql)

- generate a graphQl gateway layer to put in place of an existing Rest Api
- contract testing with GraphQl
