### Resources explored

* [Streaming Project Requests](https://www.liveedu.tv/projects/request/)
	This page is an amazing starting point for ideas on what to tackle next.
	
* [Up for grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/tags/machine-learning) - repositories in machine learning looking for contributors openly 
	At the time of publishing there are only 3 such repositories "up for grabs":
	
  - [Dive into Machine Learning](https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning) - quite a big educational resource starting from beginner level
  - [EvalAI](https://evalai.cloudcv.org/) - part of https://cloudcv.org/ , has a nice collection of ongoing challenges at the moment.
    Access to data sets and jury criteria look particularly interesting to me.
  - [Shogun](http://shogun.ml/) - Unified and efficient machine learning library (sorry I haven't done too much research on this one)

* [Bonsai](https://bons.ai/) - AI for Real-World Systems

  The company has received substantial investments lately and looks set to lead
	the pack in redefining Manufacturing and Energy (and 3 other huge markets).
	Their [blog](https://bons.ai/blog) is quite a source of inspiration.

* [Putting AI in a box at MachineBox](https://changelog.com/practicalai/2) - podcast episode on building an [ai company](https://machinebox.io/)
	
  Their blog is also particularly useful https://blog.machinebox.io/ including [My 5 favorite practical machine learning use cases](https://blog.machinebox.io/my-5-favorite-practical-machine-learning-use-cases-5ec31d692357)	
	[The podcast](https://changelog.com/practicalai) looks like something worth to lend a ear to from time to time. 

* [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org/) - Open Source community 
	with a really cool weekly newsletter, like this one [10](https://digs.openmined.org/weekly-digs-10/)
	this community is rather advanced people oriented.
	
  Their slack channel community is really welcoming.
	Unfortunately the blog only has one post, I say unfortunately because [the one post](https://blog.openmined.org/training-cnns-using-spdz/)
	is amazingly useful and well written.
